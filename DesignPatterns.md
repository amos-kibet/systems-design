### Design Patterns

- Design patterns provide lots of benefits, including:

  - Providing a general standard for communication among developers.
  - Reducing development time and speeding up the development process.
  - Providing proven solutions to common re-occurring problems.
  - Provides best practices to get a clean reusable, and bug-free codebase.
  - Providing a core/foundation upon which you can build solutions to re-occurring issues in software design.

  * There are 23 design patterns, divided into three categories, which are:
    - Structural
    - Behavioural, and
    - Creational

### Creational Design Patterns

- They deal with the way Classes and Objects are created/instantiated. There are 5 design patterns under creational design patternscategory, and they are:
  - [Abstract Factory](https://mkobuolys.medium.com/flutter-design-patterns-11-abstract-factory-7098112925d8)
  - [Factory](https://mkobuolys.medium.com/flutter-design-patterns-10-factory-method-c53ad11d863f)
  - [Builder](https://mkobuolys.medium.com/flutter-design-patterns-18-builder-cdc90b222724)
  - [Prototype](https://mkobuolys.medium.com/flutter-design-patterns-14-prototype-7d7d18bcf643)
  - [Singleton](https://mkobuolys.medium.com/flutter-design-patterns-1-singleton-437f04e923ce)

### Structural Design Patterns

- These are design patterns that deals with the way Classes and Objects get composed. It deals with the way objects combine to achieve the desired result. There are seven design patterns under this category, and they include:
  - [Adapter](https://mkobuolys.medium.com/flutter-design-patterns-2-adapter-3f05c02a7c84)

  - [Proxy](https://mkobuolys.medium.com/flutter-design-patterns-15-proxy-af8743b24269)

### Behavioural Design Patterns

- These are design patterns that deal with how Objects communicate with one another. There are 11 design patterns in this category. They include:
  - [Chain of Responsibility](https://mkobuolys.medium.com/flutter-design-patterns-20-chain-of-responsibility-2ff122624297)
